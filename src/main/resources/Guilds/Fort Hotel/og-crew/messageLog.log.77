**Scenario 1:** I Charge despite blue being closer

Result (Arrow that points to me but slightly outward): I miss ball and 2nd blue hits it, team follows rotation pattern, 2nd orange deflects for 50/50, 3rd blue hits it, 3rd orange hits 50/50, repeat till pattern is concluded with either goal or successful clear

Result (Arrow that points to me): I very unlikely manage to tap the ball, dislodging it from 2nd blue and it either goes to 3rd blue or 2nd orange clears

Result (Arrow points to 2nd blue): I miss ball and 2nd blue hits it, team follows rotation pattern, 2nd orange deflects for 50/50, 3rd blue hits it, 3rd orange hits 50/50, repeat till pattern is concluded with either goal or successful clear

**Scenario 2:** I wait for blue to hit the ball, ball goes in either of the 3 pink arrows

Result (Arrow that points to me): I clear ball b4 2nd blue gets to ball, either 3rd gets it or it flies over them
Or teammates follow up b4 3rd can react

Result (Arrow points to me but slightly outward): I clear ball even easier or 50/50 with 2nd blue.

1st blue is now doing U-Turn
2nd blue is recovering from 50/50
3rd blue is diving for ball

Which means its 2 to 1 orange:blue

Result (Arrow points to 2nd blue): 50/50

1st blue is now doing U-Turn
2nd blue is recovering from 50/50
3rd blue is diving for ball

Which means its 2 to 1 orange:blue

Slightly outward is 1;1, I agree
Arrow points to me 2:1, sure
Arrow points to 2nd blue 1:1, sure BUT that a hard doubt on 2nd orange blocks. Even at high level play a good pass that gets shot above 35 mph on goal is hard to block (at our level). Prob the worst case scenario of you charge and miss AND it goes to 2nd blue. I see it more like 0.5:1

Sep 03, 2023 12:11:47 AM disc.discbot.events.MessageListener onMessageReceived
INFO: cheeks destroyer: (Scenario you wait)
- arrow points to me, I agree 3:1 but I’m ngl the opponent would need to hit it pretty bad for it to be cleared by you. I kind of fail to see this happen tbh. Just driving at it straight makes it fly super high and hit the roof for a center or it’ll rebound off the wall for a center that’s not bouncing right in front of goal. But agreed if it does happen it’s 3:1. Realistically tho I would expect it to go over you and be cleared by the GK. It’s also that I can kind of picture myself aerialing straight up to prevent center or taking backboard position (if I was 3rd in line)

- arrow slightly outward, agree but you’d likely double commit with one of the GK considering you need to do a 90 degree turn and charge unless it goes super short to which 2nd blue seems to have more advantage. This one I feel like a 1:1 

- arrow slightly outward, feels the same as I charge and it goes to 2nd blue despite waiting or charging. I’d say 0.5:1 again

Overall hopeful 4.5:3
